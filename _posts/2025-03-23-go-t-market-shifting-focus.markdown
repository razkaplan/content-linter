## **Vibe Coding: Shifting Focus from Code to Product and Growth**

You built an app because you knew exactly what problem it solves. But your target audience? They don’t know that yet.

Even if it’s an internal tool for your team or a side project for your family, a seamless onboarding experience can dramatically boost adoption. A great app without users is like a product without a market—it won’t take off.

### **4 Steps to Align Your Prompt for a Strong Landing & Onboarding Experience**

Tools like Base44, Cursor, and Windsurf can generate landing pages and onboarding flows—but only if you guide them properly. Here’s how to set up your prompt for success:

1️⃣ **Start with the Why**  
 Tell the chat engine the core pain point your app solves.

*Example:* "I’m building a small finance app to help families track shared expenses."

2️⃣ **Define the Who**  
 Be specific about your target audience.

*Example:* "For Israeli families with at least two kids who speak only Hebrew."

3️⃣ **Map the User Journey**  
 Describe how users interact with your app.

*Example:* "All family members sign up, connect their Gmail, and see a combined expense dashboard."

4️⃣ **Prioritize Onboarding**  
 Explicitly tell the prompt engine that onboarding matters.

*Example:* "The app should have an intuitive onboarding flow, starting with a landing page that explains its value and includes a clear sign-up CTA."

### **Next Steps: Analytics & Marketing for Growth**
A great onboarding flow gets users in the door, but what happens next? To scale, you need to track user behavior and optimize acquisition strategies:

📊 **Analytics** – Implement tracking to understand where users drop off, what features they use most, and how they engage with your app. Tools like PostHog, Amplitude, or even simple Google Analytics can provide valuable insights.

📢 **Marketing** – To increase adoption, think beyond word-of-mouth. Leverage SEO, content marketing, and community-building to drive organic growth. Share your app in relevant forums, build a presence on social media, and create content that speaks to your audience’s pain points.

### **The Bottom Line**

Building is just the first step. Growth comes from positioning, onboarding, analytics, and marketing. If you want to scale beyond an MVP and get real traction, let’s talk. 🚀
